# NewsInsight-Classifier: Sri Lanka Edition

## Overview

NewsInsight Classifier: Sri Lanka Edition is a comprehensive solution designed to explore and classify news content from popular Sri Lankan news sources on Twitter. The primary goal is to predict the news source based on the article's content. This project involves data collection, preprocessing, addressing dataset imbalance, feature extraction using both sparse and dense vector representations, and training classifiers using non-deep learning and deep learning algorithms.

## Assessment Tasks

### Task (a): Identifying News Sources on Twitter

- Listed 10 popular Sri Lankan news sources with their Twitter handles, follower and following counts, and the number of tweets made in the past 12 months.

### Task (b): Extracting and Analyzing Articles

- Extracted articles indexed by the Twitter handles of the news sources.
- Provided dimensions of the resulting article collection, including total tokens and unique tokens.
- Addressed potential dataset imbalance using at least two different methods.

### Task (c): Sparse and Dense Vector Representation

- Used both sparse and dense vector representations for feature extraction.
- Interpreted the dimensions of the sparse vector and justified the dimensions of the dense vector.

### Task (d): Training Non-Deep Learning Classifiers

- Trained classifiers using three non-deep learning algorithms.
- Justified the selection of each algorithm.
- Compared and contrasted the performance of each classifier.

### Task (e): Training Deep Learning Classifiers

- Trained three deep learning classifiers with distinct architectures.
- Employed two embedding techniques and one contextual embedding technique.
- Justified the chosen architectures.
- Compared the performance of each deep learning model and interpreted the results.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the provided instructions for data collection, preprocessing, and feature extraction.
3. Execute the notebooks or scripts to train and evaluate classifiers.

## Dependencies
